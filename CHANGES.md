# Change Notes

## 2024-10-03
- New drag and drop sites
	- Font 1, Font 2, and Text word list handled separately
	- Rather than using radio buttons, drag over the TEXT or FONT table cells.
	- The cell will turn yellow as you drag
- Text lines are handled by drag and drop
 	- Showing thousands of lines took too long
	- NOTE: Text will only accept `.txt` files
- Use `fontname.js` (based on `Typr.js`) to extract font name and version.
